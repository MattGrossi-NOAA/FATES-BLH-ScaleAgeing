### Step 1: Clone the NMFS Open Science repository

This is done on the GitHub website and assumes the user already has a GitHub account and is signed in. These steps will duplicate the NOAA Open Science repo into that user’s account.

1. Navigate to the [nmfs-opensci/NOAA-quarto-simple-python](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/NOAA-quarto-simple-pyth){target="_blank"} in a web browser.

2. Click the green "Use this template" button and select "Create a new repository".

3. Select the "Include all branches" box. This is important to ensure everything works without any additional manual configuration.

4. Select a repo owner and provide a name for the new repo being created. Enter a description, if desired. (This can be changed or added later.) Select "Public".

5. Click "Create repository"

6. In the newly created repo, click "Settings" at the top of the page.

7. Select "Pages" on the side menu.

8. Enable GitHub Pages, if not already enabled, and note the URL at which the site is live. You can verify that everything worked by navigating to the site in a web browser. It should exactly like the [original web book](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/NOAA-quarto-simple-python/){target="_blank"}. Keep other settings unchanged and save any changes.

### Step 2: Clone this new repo locally

1. One the main page of the new repo, click the green "< > Code" button.

2. Copy the HTTPS web URL shown in the popup.

3. On your local computer, in a terminal window or Command Prompt, navigate to where the repo is to be downloaded, and type

   ```bash
   git clone <URL>
   ```

   where \<URL> is the web URL from [Step 2](#step-2-clone-this-new-repo-locally).2 above.

4. Press enter. The repo will now be downloaded to your local machine.

   Alternatively, after [Step 2](#step-2-clone-this-new-repo-locally).1, either use the “Open with GitHub Desktop” or the “Download ZIP” options shown above to download the repo. Be sure to unzip it if you retrieve it this way.
